1. Generate list (array) of students and their ungraded lab assignments.
   * Set up each student as their own constructor (or factory fn for a more fn program approach)
   * Properties needed:
      a. student's first name
      b. student's last name
      c. student's first-name and last initial (to create dirs like "david-a" and "david-b" if a class has two students w/ same name)
      d. student's Canvas ID#
      e. ungraded labs: an array of student's ungraded labs
      f. ungraded readings: an array of student's ungraded readings (for stretch goal to just run another Node script)
